	<h1>Milky Way</h1>
	<p>The Milky Way is a large barred spiral galaxy.<br> All the stars we see in the night sky <br>are in our own Milky Way Galaxy. Our<br> galaxy is called the Milky Way because it appears as a milky band of light<br> in the sky when you see it in a really dark area.

	<p>The Milky Way began as one or several small overdensities in the mass distribution in the Universe shortly after<br>the Big Bang 13.61 billion years ago. Some of these overdensities were the seeds of<br>globular clusters in which the oldest remaining stars in what is now the Milky Way formed.<br>Nearly half the matter in the Milky Way may have come from other distant galaxies.<br> These stars and clusters now comprise the stellar halo of the Milky Way.</p>
